    "profile.about.text": " I have had a lot of interests through life, but now my fascination with technology has taken center stage, leading me to a degree in computer engineering where programing became my favorite subject. A life long passion of drawing and art in general also lead me to learn as much as I can about creating professional looking, intuitive UIs that feel good to see and use. I am a generally reserved person, though I do enjoy teaching others what I know, a skill many of my colleagues in college appreciated. I am very adaptable, capable of learning new techniques and programming languages relatively quickly.",

    "profile.edu.text": " I enrolled into the *Instituto Polit√©cnico de Tomar* in 2015, from which I graduated in 2020 with a* Batchelor's Degree in Computer Engineering*. There I learned the basics of programming, network infrastruture, computer architecture, mathematics and eletronics. My final project involved the creation of a mobile app aiming at running a on-foot version of Rally Paper."
